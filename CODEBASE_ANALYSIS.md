- Add contribution guidelines and future roadmap

## Critical Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. Large Functions (High Priority)

**Issue:** 15+ functions exceed 50 lines, with some reaching 340+ lines
**Impact:** Reduced maintainability, increased complexity, harder testing
**Recommendation:** Refactor into smaller, focused functions

**Examples:**
- `src/app/actions.ts`: 570 lines total with 3 functions >50 lines
- `src/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx`: 340-line function
- `src/app/resume/page.tsx`: 284-line function

### 2. High Complexity Functions (High Priority)

**Issue:** Functions with complexity scores up to 28 (recommended: <10)
**Impact:** Difficult to test, maintain, and debug
**Recommendation:** Break down complex logic into smaller functions

**Examples:**
- `ProjectCard` function: 28 complexity score
- `Sandbox` function: 23 complexity score
- `handleErrorRecovery`: 25 complexity score

### 3. Console Statements in Production (Medium Priority)

**Issue:** 20+ console.log statements in production code
**Impact:** Performance degradation, potential security issues
**Recommendation:** Replace with proper logging system

### 4. React Best Practices (Medium Priority)

**Issue:** Array index usage as keys, missing Next.js Image component
**Impact:** Potential performance issues, poor user experience
**Recommendation:** Use proper keys and optimized components
